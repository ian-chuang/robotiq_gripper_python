# robotiq_gripper_python
Simple easy to use python driver for Robotiq 2F-85 and 2F-140 via USB using modbus RTU adapted from https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/robotiq_85_gripper

I noticed it was difficult to find a properly working standalone python driver. Many other repos don't work anymore, require dependencies without proper versions, or are very slow. This driver is very responsive and the only dependency is pyserial.
